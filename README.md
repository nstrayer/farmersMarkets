# Visualizing Farmers Markets Around the Country

This is a small side project to study through visualization the distribution and types of farmers markets around the country. 

Data comes from [data.gov](http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/farmers-markets-geographic-data) 

---

## To Run d3 Viz:

- Navigate to the `/d3` directory. 
- Enter `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` into the terminal. (Assuming you have python installed and are on unix.)
- Navigate to `localhost:8000` in your favorite web browser. 

## Further Interesting Questions To Ask: 

- [x] Which state has the most/least farmers markets? 
- [x] What about per capita?
- [ ] What about by % of gdp raised by farming to markets per capita? 
	- [Data Source](http://www.bea.gov/regional/) 	
- [ ] Most isolated farmers markets?
- [ ] Can you predict where a farmers market is by what it sells?
- [ ] Do places with water shortages have a higher proportion of non water-intensive products?

## Form of Second visualization: 
- Scrolling form. 
- Each section corresponding to my investigation steps per above.
- Make it bootstrap style where they can select from a menu to go straight to that menu section. Kinda a mixture of narative and free-explore.
